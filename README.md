# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Key Features:

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a delightful gaming experience with features like a responsive layout, game logic, win-checking, and interactive user interface.

## How I approached this project:

In approaching this project, I meticulously planned the game logic and designed a visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS. JavaScript was employed to handle player moves, check for wins or draws, and update the game board in real-time.
